# Project Overview

K-means Clustering is an **unsupervised** machine learning project focused on grouping data into clusters based on similarity. It helps identify patterns in data without predefined labels. This technique is widely used in customer segmentation, market basket analysis, anomaly detection, and image compression.
# Features

- Implementation of K-means clustering algorithm from scratch / with libraries (as per notebook).

- Ability to visualize clusters and understand group separation.

- Customizable for different datasets.

- Documentation included with explanations and results.
# Workflow Overview

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Import dataset, clean, and normalize it.

- **Cluster Initialization** – Choose number of clusters (k).

- **Clustering Process** – Assign data points to nearest cluster centroid and update centroids iteratively.

- **Convergence Check** – Repeat until centroids stabilize.

- **Visualization & Insights** – Plot clusters and analyze grouping results.
# Tech Stack

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

# Libraries:

- numpy – numerical computations

- pandas – data handling

- matplotlib / seaborn – visualization

- scikit-learn – machine learning utilities
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project.

2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
4. Run K-means Clustering.ipynb step by step

5. Explore results and modify dataset or parameters (like k) for experiments
